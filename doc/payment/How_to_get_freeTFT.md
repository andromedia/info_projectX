## How to get FreeTFT, to be used for exploring the grid

A setup has been made so that each 3Bot gets 1000 FreeTFTs for consumption of our test network. As TFTs are registered on the Stellar network, XLMs are needed to allow transfers and setting up of accounts. 
Showing XLM in the 3Bot Connect wallet is planned but not yet implemented. 
Here you can find how to start trading FreeTFT and TFT on the Stellar network anyway. 
First create a wallet. A web wallet, able to do trading with other cryptocurrencies, is available on [the web wallet](https://interstellar.exchange/) . Alternatively there are a number of wallets available on the market that can be used. 
An overview of possible wallets can be found [here](https://themoneymongers.com/best-stellar-xlm-wallets/) 
Trading TFTs is only possible after first buying a number of XLMs as these are needed to set up your account and create a trustline to your TFT wallet. 
For your info, on testnet you get a number of XLMs for free which you can claim using testnet.interstellar.exchange. 
We provide you also with 1000 FreeTFTs per 3bot, which can be used to start exploring our grid and pay for the capacity. 
Once you have tokens available, you can start trading : 

For TFT, you need to add TFT first to your wallet, adding also a trustline.

For the first time, a manual setup is needed. 
Asset code = TFT (capital letters)
Asset issuer = the issuer of the token on the Stellar Network, this is a fixed string (always the same). 
On testnet, issuer of TFT = GA47YZA3PKFUZMPLQ3B5F2E3CJIB57TGGU7SPCQT2WAEYKN766PWIMB3
(please keep in mind that Stellar testnet is reset every quarter ) 
On mainnet, issuer of TFT = GBOVQKJYHXRR3DX6NOX2RRYFRCUMSADGDESTDNBDS6CDVLGVESRTAC47
Stellar works with trustlines (establishment of it costs a very small amount of XLMs). This trustline needs to be established as well. 

For trading you need to define both the currencies and the issuer: 

For the first time, a manual setup is needed. 2 parameters need to be defined : 
‘Asset code’ is the token identifier, in our case TFT (capital letters)
Asset issuer is the issuer of the token on the Stellar Network, this is a fixed string (always the same). 
On testnet, issuer = GA47YZA3PKFUZMPLQ3B5F2E3CJIB57TGGU7SPCQT2WAEYKN766PWIMB3
(please keep in mind that Stellar testnet is reset every quarter ) 
On mainnet, issuer (of TFT) = GBOVQKJYHXRR3DX6NOX2RRYFRCUMSADGDESTDNBDS6CDVLGVESRTAC47

Once 2 currencies have been selected, you can start trading.
