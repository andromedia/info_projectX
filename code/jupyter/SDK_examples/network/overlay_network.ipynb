    "\n",
    "In order to be able to deploy this example deployment you will have to have the following components activated\n",
    "- the 3bot SDK, in the form of a local container with the SDK, or a grid based SDK container.  Installation instuctions are here <<insert pointer to the linux of macos installation manuea>>\n",
    "- if you use a locally installed container with the 3bot SDK you need to have the wireguard software installed.  Instructions to how to get his installed on your platform can be found [here](https://www.wireguard.com/install/)\n",
    "- capacity reservation are not free so you will need to have some ThreeFold Tokens (TFT) to play around with.\n",
